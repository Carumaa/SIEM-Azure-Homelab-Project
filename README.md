A Security Information and Event Management System (SIEM) serves as a shield for organizations, aiding in the identification, assessment, and mitigation of security risks before they disrupt business functions. It acts as a centralized hub, gathering event logs from diverse network sources like Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and Identity solutions. This aggregation enables security experts to actively monitor, prioritize, and address potential threats as they arise. On the other hand, a honeypot functions as a strategic decoy within a secure environment, designed to ensnare malicious actors. By deliberately exposing a system to compromise, analysts can scrutinize attacker methodologies, assess various threat vectors, and refine security protocols. 


The objective of this project lies in gathering attack data from honeypots, integrating it into a SIEM for analysis, and presenting the findings in a comprehensible format. Specifically, the data will be visualized on a global map, depicting event frequencies and corresponding geolocations.
